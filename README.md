# The Project Brief 

Untrodden is the result of the Final project set during the School of Code Bootcamp. We were given four weeks to come up with a working product that met the criteria specified in the project brief.

We were given a very open project brief which was to "solve a real world problem and put users at the center of the project"

# Our App and Features

We settled on solving the problem of the increased cost of living and travel costs combined with restricted freedom of movement by building a site that highlights unique and not so well known beauty spots in the United Kingdom, with the key aspect being that it is free and community-oriented so people can share their own unique spots with the community.  <strong>-tidy this up</strong>


## Generating and Selecting Ideas

Our first meeting was spent getting to know each other, deciding our team manifesto and then each of us coming up with problems we thought could be solved effectively through the use of technology. We came up with many varied problems and solutions between us so started to whittle them down.

Initially, we chose to explore several ideas but went down the path of a Skills Share Website However, we soon realised we hadnâ€™t explored any other options properly, so decided to take a step back, re-assess all of the problems we had identified and make a new decision using the dot voting system.Dot voting was an extremely useful tool that we used at various stages during our project journey.



## Disney Ideation and WireFrames

After finalised our project idea we then went on to the Disney Ideation process, created some user stories and profiles, Low-Fidelity and High Fidelity Wireframes, and created a Component Tree.

# Building the MVP

## What we learned

- How to work efficiently in a large Agile team, making sure that everyone is heard whilst also ensuring that tasks get completed on time. We managed to maintain a beautiful and healthy team atmosphere throughout the project,being respectful and working efficiently whilst maintaining an atmosphere of fun and playfulness. It was a wonderful experience and we are all sad to see it end.

- We quickly fell into a daily routine consisting of morning standups, and quick end of day retrospectives. Working this way allowed us to pivot quickly and make changes to our plan as and when needed.

- We also got into the habit of doing daily merges and regular deploys.This allowed us to solve small bite sized problems regularly, rather than giant stress inducing problems at the end of each week.

- We decided to push ourselves out of our comfort zones a bit and build our app with Nextjs. After researching the pros and cons of the Framework we decided it was more suited to the app we wanted to create, than what we were familiar with.(standard React). Nextjs offers Server side rendering and built in routing out of the box, making our app easily scalable and also optimised the performance for the user over standalone react.

- We incorporated several pieces of new technology into our apps that we hadn't used before, including; Mapbox, Cloudinary, AuthO, Material UI and React Hook form. Although, they each came with their own challenges, we managed to persevere, work together and integrate them successfully into our apps. We learned that not all docs are created equal but me managed to navigate them none the less.

- How to navigate github and avoid merging disasters! After this project we all feel much more comfortable with the various features of git, such as merging and branching.

- The benefits of user feedback. After the second week of development we sent out user feedback and the responses were invaluable. Users points out some bugs we had missed and also improvements that could be made in our UI. Although this resulted in us having to ditch some of the code we wrote, we remembered the importance of not getting attached to ideas and focused on the users needs.

- During planning week we found that we would spend a lot of time ideating on a particular idea and then get spend a lot of time getting caught up in smaller details. Thus, we decided to give ourselves time limits for different ideation phases, in order to ensure that we progressed effectively.
